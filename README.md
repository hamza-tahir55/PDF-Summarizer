## About

PDF Summarizer is a Flask web application that processes PDF files, extracts the main content, and generates a summary using text summarization techniques.

## Features

- Upload PDF files for processing.
- Extract text from uploaded PDF files.
- Generate a summary of the text content.
- Display the summary on a web page.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamza-tahir55/PDF-Summarizer

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PDF-Summarizer
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

3. Upload a PDF file using the provided form.

4. The application will process the uploaded file, generate a summary, and display it on the page.

## Implementation Details

1. TextRank Algorithm: Explain how the TextRank algorithm is implemented to summarize the text extracted from PDF files. This could involve details about how sentences are represented as nodes in a graph, how edges between nodes are weighted based on similarity or co-occurrence, and how the graph is iteratively ranked to produce a summary.

2. PDF Processing: Describe how the application parses PDF files to extract text content. This might involve using libraries like PyMuPDF (fitz) to load PDF documents, iterate through pages, and extract text.

3. Preprocessing: Discuss any preprocessing steps applied to the text before summarization, such as removing noise, punctuation, or stop words, as well as any normalization or tokenization procedures.

4. Summarization Output: Explain how the summarization results are generated and presented to the user. This could involve formatting the summary text, selecting a certain number of sentences based on their importance scores, or any post-processing steps applied to improve readability.

5. Integration with Flask: Detail how the Flask web application is structured and how the summarization functionality is integrated into the application's routes and templates.
